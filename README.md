# Smart Home Authorization Server
A Phoenix service to control access to smart home devices

**WORK IN PROGESS**

</div>


## Running

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Edit database config in `config/dev.exs`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`


## Development

`insomnia.json` is an export of the [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest)
workspace I'm currently using to develop the API.
It should have most routes and authentication configured
